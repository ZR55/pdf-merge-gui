# pdf-merge-gui
This is a little program that intends to merge pdf files.

Currently this program supports merging multiple PDF files which should locate in the same folder and generating the merged PDF file to your Desktop. If the files are encrypted, the program will prompt you to enter the password.


## Installation

It's a real simple program so there's only one file. Download the file to your device and run `python pdf-merge-gui.py` in the shell.
